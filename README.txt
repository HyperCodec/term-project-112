Maze Runner

The goal of this game is simple: Find your way to the bottom right corner of the maze without getting caught.

The controls are the following:
- arrow keys to move
- hold z to sprint
- press f (while on a hiding spot) to enter/exit hiding.

Enemies will aggro if they have a direct line of sight to you (the player).
Hiding in the plants that can be found scattered throughout the maze will cause them to lose track of your location.

How to run the game

First, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Some packages like pycairo may have
a more complex setup process on certain operating systems.
It is recommanded that you use a virtual environment when installing dependencies to avoid conflicts.


Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run `python main.py`
(or whatever editor-specific command runs `main.py`) to start the game.
